# JWT Module

The main JWT module on its own just provides a framework for managing a
single site-wide key and integration with a JWT library.

The JWT module can used to authenticate requests from a JWT in the header, but
by default does not.

If you want to use the simple / default authentication behavior you need to
also enable the jwt_auth_consumer module.

If you want to allow users to generate a JWT at a web path (or use the API
to create a JWT with default claims), you need to also enable the jwt_auth_issuer
module.

## Site Key

Go to /admin/config/system/keys and add a JWT HMAC or RSA key.

Go to /admin/config/system/jwt to pick the key to be used.

## JWT Header and Claims

When creating a JWT to send, the iat and exp claims should be included.

The namespaced claim "drupal / uid" is used by jwt_auth_consumer to determine the
user account to be used when authenticated. You can also use a user uuid or
username with claims "drupal / uuid" or "drupal / name". The claims are
checked in the order listed here, and the first one that's populated is
used to determine the user.

## Request Header

The JWT may be sent in either of two headers. The fallback header is intended for use
in development environments that are protected by basic authentication, e.g. to block
web crawlers.

Main header format:

    Authorization: Bearer [token]

Fallback header:

    JWT-Authorization: Bearer [token]

## API Integration

For REST api integration (e.g. Views) enable the jwt_auth authentication option.
